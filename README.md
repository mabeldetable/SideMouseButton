This project was because I used AHK to rebind my side mouse buttons to be copy and paste.
That wasn't very secure :( so work banned it :((
Watching the 'Defender has removed a PUP from your device' message pop up was one of the most harrowing moments of my life.
The guy from work who chatted to me about it misspelt my name in his timesheet, to add insult to injury.
Can't be having shortcuts in life be stripped from me like that, so I coded it in Python and turned into an exe.
Might ask work if I can use the exes as like a birthday present or something...

Anyway - the actual code - fuck knows, I don't know how to code so did a lot of googling.
Used a stolen script to work out what the mouse buttons were called and then just popped those in.

Typing in this README makes me feel rather codey, so I might just keep going.
Currently listening to 'Day Month Second' by GIRLI - not really sure what it is about - is it a missunderstanding of how time works? There are a lot of units in between days, months and seconds...
Can't think of anything more to type, so that cool codey feeling has been shortlived.
Bye :)
